# Project Tango Plugin Example Content Project
The Project Tango Plugin Example Content Project contains a set of levels that
demonstrate the usage of each of the components that form the Plug-In.

## Quick Setup
This project contains the Project Tango Plugin as a submodule, to quickly
initialize both this project and the plugin, execute this command:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/opaquemultimedia/ProjectTangoPluginExampleContent.git`

Once the project has started, the Plug-In should already be enabled. If not,
simply browse the plug-in menu and enable it. Each level does not require any
configuration, so pick a level and launch.
